I like making art, playing video games, and watching anime. I am currently in my junior year of highschool and am taking web design at my school. I like to re-invent the websites of some of my favorite companies to improve their visual layout aswell as their navigational capabilities. I'm new to coding, but I am learning quickly and hope to increase my knoweledge through the use of Github!
